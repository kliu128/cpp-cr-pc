The Clash Royale Card Probability Calculator! This project is predicted to
take about a month to complete so be patient young one! 
The user will enter his/her arena number, chest type, and the rarity of the card wanted. 
From that, the program will give a probability of that card being pulled. 


The base program is coded in C++ and if you have experience feel free to help! 
You can download the source files and edit it any way your desires will lead, and you may distribute it.
The only requirement is to give credit and a link to this repository.
